Welcome to the Origins2 public repository. Origins was a project started by Razorcane to help introduce him to the world of Java programming.  The original version of Origins was tailored to a specific server, however the newer versions will be programmed to work on multiple servers.  Origins2 is another attempt to further Razorcane's Java knowledge.

If you wish to work on Origins2, or you want some general background into how Java works, feel free to make a fork of this repository.

Origins2 is licensed under the 3-Clause BSD License, though I ask that the project not be distributed, especially since it is woefully incomplete. Once there is a beta build ready to be released, I will be the one to release it.
